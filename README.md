# Overview
Consider the graph presented below. Each node represents a single state (or the District of Columbia (DC)). If two states are neighbors, there is an edge between them. <br>

Assume that edge weights represent driving distances between state capitals. The task is using greedy best-first search and A* to find the path from the initial state to the goal state. The label names of the initial states and goal states follow the abbreviation of the state shown in the image above.
